- Parallelise the raytracer.
	- Divide the image into a grid of tiles.
	- Create a set of worker threads which read from a work queue.
- If performance gain is not enough, then do further optimisation work by benchmarking app.
- Move onto RayTracing the next weekend.

- Performance
	- Single thread, 100 samples, 200px width: ~32secs
	- Parallel.For, 100 samples, 200px width, Random with lock: ~9-10secs
	- Parallel.For, 100 samples, 200px width, ThreadLocalRandom: ~7secs
	- Parllel.For with ThreadLocalRandom ~78% faster than Single Thread
